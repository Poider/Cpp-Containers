check in cpp reference header if the func is defined or not 

in vector you only wanna allocate occassionally so allocate works

check if iterators default constructor need to do smth

test all iterator operations (check if stuff that should work with const works with const / shouldnt be changed)

check if typdef const typename works // I think it does

allocate sizeof
construct(allocatedptr, value);

if capacity is not enough double
